h2. Status

Almost certainly doesn't work with Rails 3, though I haven't tried. I will update it if the fancy takes me.

h2. HTML Output

This miniscule Rails plugin stops Rails outputting self-closing (XHTML-style) markup
which is useful if you want to use the Rails tag helpers and produce valid HTML.

HTML Output
===========

This miniscule Rails plugin stops Rails outputting self-closing (XHTML-style) markup
which is useful if you want to use the Rails tag helpers and produce valid HTML.

Works with Rails 2.3 and 3.0.

Install
-------

* Rails 3: Add `gem "rails_html_output"` to your `Gemfile`.
* Rails 2.3: Add `config.gem "rails_html_output"` to your `config/environment.rb`.
